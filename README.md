# ‚úàÔ∏è IA_UdeA_FlightPredict

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of flight delays using historical data from various airlines during 2015. The goal is to understand the factors that influence delays, such as the origin airport, the airline, and the interactions between origin and destination airports, to improve prediction accuracy and propose solutions to anticipate these issues.
